Brother problem is only with Bluebit.MatrixLibrary (http://www.bluebit.gr/NET/download.aspx) because I am doing nothing.
Its giving this exception when project is compiled, build.
The version of Bluebit.MatrixLibrary i am using is 6.1 (64-bit) which is latest and it targets .NET Framework 4. 
Therefore, my project's target framework is also 4.0 just because of this library.

I made Desktop app using the same .dll file. You can also check desktop app in UPlagSolution repository. 

Two things worth mentioning here :
   -> Assembly of my project is signed (keypair.snk file is included).
   -> LICENCE file is also included in bin folder. LIC file for Bluebit.MatrixLibrary
These instruction were given by the owner of Bluebit. when he gave me developer license.
